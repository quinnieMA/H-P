This_company, through_its_subsidiaries, is engaged in developing and commercializing radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment of CAUSE_OF_DEATH. It was_incorporated in DATE. The company is headquartered in CITY,_STATE_OR_PROVINCE, ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION pipeline programs include lutetium - 177 and actinium - 225. Its clinical - stage product_candidates include PNT2003 and PNT2002 for the treatment of CAUSE_OF_DEATH_CAUSE_OF_DEATH and neuroendocrine tumors. Its preclinical stage product_candidates include Lu - PNT2004 and Lu - PNT2001. PNT2002 is a prostate - specific membrane antigen (ORGANIZATION), targeted radioligand is in Phase III trial for the treatment of metastatic castration - resistant CAUSE_OF_DEATH_CAUSE_OF_DEATH (mCRPC). PNT2002 combines a PSMA - specific ligand, PSMA - I&T, with the beta - emitting radioisotope lutetium - 177 (177Lu - PSMA - I&T). PNT2004 is a family of fibroblast activation protein - alpha (FAP - alpha), which targeted radioligands. PNT2003 is a somatostatin - targeted radioligand in development for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors.The company is also developing PNT2001, PNT2004, and CAUSE_OF_DEATH microenvironment targeting technology platform. PNT2001, PSMA - targeting product TITLE, is evaluated for the treatment of non-metastatic castration sensitive CAUSE_OF_DEATH_CAUSE_OF_DEATH (nmCSPC). PNT - 2004, is a fibroblast activation protein - a, (FAP - a), targeted radioligand, is evaluated for the treatment of solid tumors.
