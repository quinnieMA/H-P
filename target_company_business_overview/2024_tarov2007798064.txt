This company is in charge of developing a NUMBER_megawatt (MW) net solar thermal_power project to_be located near CITY, about NUMBER_kilometers east of the coastal town of LOCATION. The project is being developed by ORGANIZATION, and is scheduled to reach commercial operation in DATE. It was_incorporated in DATE DATE and is based in CITY, Chile.The company 's CITY project will comprise NUMBER NUMBER_megawatt (MW, NUMBER_MW gross) solar thermal towers with DURATION_DURATION_DURATION_DURATION thermal storage, combined_with NUMBER_MW of PV. The hybrid project will deliver over NUMBER gigawatt DURATION (GW h) SET, as non-intermittent baseload power, DURATION_DURATION_DURATION_DURATION. The project uses heliostat mirrors that collect and focus the sun 's thermal energy to heat molten salt flowing through a solar_power tower. The molten salt circulates from the tower to a storage tank, where_it is then used to_produce steam and generate electricity. Excess thermal energy is stored in the molten salt and can_be_used to_generate power for DURATION_DURATION_DURATION_DURATION, including during the TIME DURATION and when direct sunlight is not available. The project 's solar tower component technology is based on the ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION in the COUNTRY.
